# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
I had wished to find out the relation between the ratings of each place and their link to nearby bicycle stands.

(but because of the below mentioned challenges I ended up just doing the model for fsq and ylp dataframe)

## Process
1) I extracted the data from all three api's one by one. 
2) Tested them to find out the details. First I thought Yelp has better data because it was easier to deal with but as difficult as foursquare was I think foursquare has more potential.
3) After deducing results and doing the data visualization I find little to none corelations amongst the parameters.

## Results
It was like a magic code, with single line of data I had worlds data in my computer REAL TIME!! 
Very cool!!
Although I would say that this was a null data and did not generate any useful information or any co-relation amongst the parameters.

## Challenges 
This project was extremely challenging for me. It was not only difficult but I also had a lot of technology issues.
1)Citybikes api was broken and i ccould not get any results from it, I had spoken with couple mentors but unfortunately, no soulution. So in the after several hours of documentation reading and all I was able to get some results.
2) I also had a severe migraine ( I usually get that when it's too cold).
3) And on top of that my jupyter labs kernel restarted itself cz of some error and I lost all my code.
so I had to quickly redo it again from all I remembered in order to submit this project on time.


## Future Goals
From all these challanges I faced during this project has made me forcefully learn from my mistakes and I'll be prepared in my next project and will give my best.
