# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
I had wished to find out the relation between the ratings of each place and their link to nearby bicycle stands.



## Process
1) I extracted the data from all three api's one by one. 
2) Tested them to find out the details. First I thought Yelp has better data because it was easier to deal with but as difficult as foursquare was I think foursquare has more potential.
3) After deducing results and doing the data visualization I find little to none corelations amongst the parameters.
4) Sidenote- using yelp api for Russian data, I was not able to get any results.
## Results
It was like a magic code, with single line of data I had worlds data in my computer REAL TIME!! 
Very cool!!
Although I would say that this was a null data and did not generate any useful information or any co-relation amongst the parameters.

## Challenges 
This project was extremely challenging for me. It was not only difficult but I also had a lot of technology issues.
I have lost count how many times I did this project. haha!
## Future Goals
From all these challanges I faced during this project has made me forcefully learn from my mistakes and I'll be prepared in my next project.
